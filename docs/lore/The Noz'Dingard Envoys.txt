The Noz'Dingard Envoys

The sounds of the urban crowd animated the Noz'Dingard market. It was more grumble and protest that actual noise, in fact there was a lot of jostling. If you looked closer, you could also see a frantic race. A young boy called Zahal was chased by what seemed to be a young female warrior. The poor boy was exausted, he gasped and his heart was pounding. Actually, he did not know exactly why he was fleeing, perhaps by reflex, his life had not always been generous with him , the boy did have a conscious and knew that he did not always take the right decision or the right path. He took fright when seeing a Witchblade, one of the guardians of the Noz temple, she was searching the tavern, obviously looking for someone who happened to be the boy in question. He started running and this is how they both ended up tumbling through narrow streets. Zahal could no longer feel his legs, the boy quickly glanced behind him and saw nothing, what a relief! He took advantage of this and headed into a dark alley to take a quick break. Unfortunately, it was short, he suddenly felt the tip of a sharp cold blade on his back.

-I’ve got you now ! said the exhausted voice -Now I understand why he wants to see you..

- Wh.. Who ?? Look I don’t quite understand your story, this is obviously a terrible misunderstanding.

- Tis not... replied the woman


A little later, at the heart of the Bound district. Zahal felt like he was dreaming, indeed, he had only been in Noz’ Dingard a few hours and was already completely amazed by what he saw, people had told him old stories about these forbidden places but he never thought he’d find himself here one day. The light passing through the huge dominant crystal was blue, giving a warm and special feeling to this place. The young man remained speechless before such splendor and did not even feel scared to why they were taking him to this place. On the way to the secret place, they met several other fierce Witchblades, they all saluted the woman who captured Zahal with respect, it would seem that she belongs to a higher rank. After passing through several doors covered with dragon engravings, they arrived in a large courtyard at the foot of the huge crystal. A small group of people interrupted their discussion to acknowledge their arrival. A young woman that looked just like Zahal’s jailer approached them.

- So Moira, you took your sweet time, did he give you a hard time? A hint of sarcasm could be heard in her tone.

- I don’t think you could of done better Eglantyne, plus I didn’t use the power of our beloved dragon for such a little task..unlike some..

- Yeah yeah that’s what they all say haha.. Anyway...

The woman did not even have time to finish what she was saying when a bright blue light flashed and blinded the whole area. This source came from the crystal. All turned around and attempted to watch where this source was coming from.The light stopped gradually revealing a tall man covered in a blue dress with sharp scales. Everyone at the scene expected this man to say something, but he said nothing and walked towards Moira and Zahal.

- You are finally among us, Dragon has been waiting for you for quite some time now.

- Look I don’t understand what you are talking about, who are you, what do you want from me ?

- You are lost my friend, you do not know what is happening, do not worry. I am Prophet, the Dragon’s voice. Go through this door and everything will become much clearer for you.

Zahal looked at everyone to check if Prophet was talking to someone else, they remained silent and stared right at him. Zahal turned around and walked towards the door. The door opened naturally and the boy entered with courage. The small group stayed there waiting the return of their new recruit. This was an opportunity for them to talk about their reunion.

- So Prophet...Are you going to tell us why we are all reunited today? said Alishk.

- Patience isn’t your virtue is it Alishk ?

Prophet stood up and turned his back to his people for a few seconds.

- However,I do think it is time you know the truth.

Prophet took a deep breath and remained silent for a few seconds.

- Two days ago, a large object crashed . The Dragon felt that it is in fact a gigantic Heart-Gem and it is currently disturbing the Harmony.

- And our Dragon wants us to go right ? interrupted Moira.

- Yes, all of you.

- All of us?! shouted Eglantyne.

- Our Dragon has felt incredible danger upon the arrival of this stone, this is why we are all going...

Before Prophet could finish, the door blew wide open. Zahal came out dressed like a Noz’Dingard warrior and had gained some height and muscle! Next to him was a beautiful woman and two strange creatures: Koonok, the blue dragon and Bomzar, the crystal Golem. - Noz’ Dingard Envoys, I salute you! said the smiling woman.

Most of the people present did not know her or had ever seen her before, however some knew that this person was legendary. For the first time in years, Prophet actually smiled after seeing this woman.

- Mother?? said Prophet. It’s been 5 years since I last saw you. People could clearly hear a bizarre mixture of joy and ressentment in Prophet’s voice.

- Prophet my child, I don’t have the same notion of time than you have, did I ...miss you ?

- Of course mother, what an odd question..

- We will have plenty of time to talk later my boy. The woman looked at the group, smiled, took a deep breath and said.

- My dear warriors, please welcome your new DRAGON KNIGHT Zahal!

- Dragon Knight? It’s been a while since we’ve seen one of those Anryena.. I must say that I’m a bit worried.

Anryena’s face suddenly turned very serious

- Aerouant, my boy, we are under the protection of the Dragon, nothing can happen to us. You are just going to have to take a leap of faith and trust me.
